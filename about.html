                    <p>
                        I am an Ukrainian electric and double bass player, based in Kyiv, who was fortunate
                        to play as a sideman with many others jazz artists. I was born in Rogatyn in Western Ukraine.
                        My family moved to Ivano-Frankivsk at first, and then to Kyiv, therefore I grew up in those
                        two cities. I am mostly self-taught musician, although I had been taking private lessons and
                        have been attending workshops for jazz musicians as well. Here are some of them:
                        <ul class="workshoplist">
                            <li class="worshoplist_item">"Cho-jazz" (Chodzie≈º, Poland);</li>
                            <li class="worshoplist_item">"Lviv Summer Jazz School" (Lviv, Ukraine);</li>
                            <li class="worshoplist_item">"New York Jazz Masters"(Trzebnica, Poland).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I graduated from'Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv' in 2006,
                        where I studied history, but shortly after that, music became my only activity.
                    </p>
                <h2 class="article-heading experience">Performance experience</h2>
